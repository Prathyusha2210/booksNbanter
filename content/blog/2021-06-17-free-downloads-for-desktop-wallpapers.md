Hey guys! 

I have been trying out Graphic Design for quite some time. And, so far have made a few posters, presentations and personal branding posts for Instagram and LinkedIn.

I am no Designer, but I like to share my work with you for fun.

Below are a few designs: Desktop Wallpapers, posters, bookmarks and all other stuff you can download and print or just can use as you see fit.

I will be sharing more downloadables soon! Do share your feedback so that it helps me get better.

In case you are wondering how I made these, Check out Canva a graphic design tool where you can find tons of templates to get started with, for absolutely free.

Canva is a great tool and is so beginner friendly. I would like to write a series of blogs on getting started with Canva if any of you are interested in it.. do let me know about this as well and yeah enjoy these freebies for now!..
